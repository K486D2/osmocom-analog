This is a generator for the C-Netz Sim Card
"Berechtigungskarte als Speicherkarte".

The Smart Card "Berechtigungskarte als Prozessorkarte" is not supported.

After generation, the hex data can be copied to the data array of simcard.ino
and written to an SLE4428 or compatible.

Note: The SLE card must not have protected serial number area. (ATR area)
Also the card must show all 416 written bits via ATR, not only 32 bits.

Tested:
Works with BSA 51
Does not work with all other phones I have.
