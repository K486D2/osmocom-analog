This software implements base station protocol of classic mobile phones. With
radio transmitter and receiver connected to one sound card and a headset
connected to another sound card, it is possible to make and receive calls to
and from mobile phone. With SDR (software defined radio) it can be use without
radio equipment connected to a sound card, and even multiple channels can be
generated simultaniously using SDR. Currently supported networks:

 * A-Netz
 * B-Netz (ATF-1)
 * C-Netz
 * NMT 450 / 900 (Nordic Mobile Telephone)
 * AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System)
 * TACS (Total Access Communication System)
 * JTACS (Japanese version of TACS)
 * Radiocom 2000 (French network)
 * IMTS / MTS ((Improved) Mobile Telephone Service)
 * MPT1327 (Trunked Radio) aka known as 'Buendelfunk'
 * Eurosignal (ERuRD paging service)
 * 5-Ton-Folge (ZVEI 5 tone paging code for pager and siren trigger)
 * JollyCom (Unofficial network, invented by the author)
 * C-Netz BSC (Connecting to a C-Netz Base Station)

Additionally the following communication services are implemented:

 * TV Transmitter with test Images
 * Radio transmitter / receiver
 * Analog Modem Emulation 'Datenklo' (AM7911)
 * German classic 'Zeitansage' (talking clock)
 * POCSAG transmitter / receiver
 * Golay/GSC transmitter / receiver
 * DCF77 time signal transmitter and receiver with weather info
 * C-Netz SIM emulator
 * C-Netz magnetic card emulator
