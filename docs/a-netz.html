Now run your base station on channel 30.
Tune the transmitter to 162.050 MHz and the receiver to 157.550.
You should tune the receiver to 164.050 first, to check if you hear the idle signal from the base station.
Then tune to actually uplink frequency 157.550 MHz.

Turn on you phone and wait for it to warm up (requires about half a minute).
Tune the phone to channel 30 and switch on your transmitter for the base station.
The phone should indicate a (green) light, to show idle channel.
If there is no green light, increase the level of your FM signal on the transmitter.
Or if you can't increase the audio level on the transmitter, do it with 'alsamixer'.

<p align='justify'>
When you pick up the phone, the phone transmits a 1750 Hz calling tone.
On reception at the base station, the base station removes the 2280 Hz idle tone.
After that the call is establised.
After establishment, you can use the headset, if present, for speech communication with the phone.
On hangup, the phone transmit a 1750 Hz hangup tone.
Then the base station returns to idle again and sends the 2280 Hz idle tone.
Be sure that the phone turns off the transmitter and indicates the (green) light.

<p align='justify'>
To call to the phone, be sure that your transmitter transmits loud enough to send 4 sine waves at once.
Enter the last 5 digits of the phone's number and press 'd' to dial.
If you listen to the transmit signal, you should hear 4 low pitched tones at once.
The phone should now turn off the green light and indicate an incomming call with a yellow light and a buzzer sound.
There is no acknowledgement from the phone until you pick up the call.
If the phone does not indicate an incomming call, increase the volume of the transmit signal, but be sure not to overdrive it.
Also be sure that you are actually dialing the right number, so the base station generates the correct paging tones for your phone.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
Instead of transmitting all 4 tones at once, they can be transmitted after each other.
Each tone is playes for a short time.
After the last tone has been played, base station starts again with the first tone.
My phone also responds to a call, even if the tones cycle rather than sent simultaniously.
In this case the level of each tone is two times highter (+3 dB), but the peak level is two times lower (-3 dB) than the peak level of 4 simultanious tones.
Add command line option "-P 50" to send each tone for 50 milliseconds.
Try something between 20-100 milliseconds, if the phone still doesn't ring.
Be sure to check: Does your transmitter has enough frequency deviation (15 KHz is suggested)? Do you really send the correct number of your phone, check the frequencies of your phone and use "-D 0" option to see what 4 frequencies the base station actually transmits.
