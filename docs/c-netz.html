Setup of a base station
</p>

<p>
When I first started with testing early C-Netz implementation, I had great trouble getting a response from a mobile phone.
The main problem was clock speed of the transmitted signal.
The base stations were all synchronized with a high precision clock.
All base stations transmit on the same control channel 131 ('Orgakanal'), but at different time slots.
The phone expects that the time slots repeat precisely every 2.4 seconds.
The specs say that the phone requires clock speed deviation of +- 1 PPM (Parts Per Million) or less.
To comply with the specs, the base stations needs to have a clock deviation far below 1 PPM.
(I guess that there is a tollerance, so maybe a few PPM deviation would make no big problem.)
We need to calibrate the speed of our transmit signal (and receive signal as well).

<p>
First of all, we need a reference clock.
Since most systems have standard crystals, we cannot use our system clock as reference without any help.
I decided to use the NTP daemon.
After running the system for one day, the clock speed should be accurate enough for our needs.
Be sure to choose a place with constant temperature.

<p>
One notices that I have quite an unprecise crystal in my test machine.
Since I have NTP running, the system clock is now far below 1 PPM.
</p>

<p>
The second problem is the clock of our sound adapter.
They use own crystals.
Because they are made for audio signals (and not for high precise base stations), they can't be used without calibration.
Cheap USB adapters may even have different clocks on TX and RX.
I found out that the clock speed changes when the USB voltage changes.
The USB voltage changes, when the current changes, due to different volumes on the output.
To minimize this effect, don't use extension cables.
</p>

<p>
Since we have precise system clock now, we can measure the speed of our sound adapter.
Later we will use the measurement result to adjust our signal processor.
Be sure to have your machine running for at least 24 hours (with your sound adapter attached).
The machine must have network connection to the NTP server.
I suggest to use 'ntp1.ptb.de' and 'ntp2.ptb.de' as reference.
Use command line option '-M' or '--measure' to measure my sound adapter.
Let it run for one hour.

<p>
One can see that the measured clock from the sound card (sample rate) differs about +19.45 PPM.
Because I did not do any correction to the signal processing, the same error applies to the signal.
Use command line option '-S 19.45,19.45' or '--clock-speed 19.45,19.45' to compensate the clock error by adjusting the signal processor.
Let it run again for one hour and you will see that signal is now below 1 PPM.
(Or close to it.)

<p>
C-Netz uses FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) by directly modulating the carrier, rather than modulating a transmitted tone.
The advantage is much higher data rate.
The base station's carrier frequency is raised by 2.5 KHz to transmit a logical "1" and lowered by 2.5 KHz to transmit a logial "0".
(The mobile station transmits reversed polarity.) 
The mobile station will only detect the correct polarity.
The three sync words of "11100010010", is shown in the picture above.
In the picture above, the polarity is wrong.
(The logical "1" points down and the logical "0" points up.)
You must check, with what polarity your transmitter is doing a positive frequency deviation.
Also you must check your sound card's polarity on positive value beeing sent.
To change polarty, use command line option '-F' or '--flip-polarity'.
(Note: don't confuse with '-P'!)
</p>

<p>
This software does not care about what polarity it receives from the mobile station.
It just checks for sync words with both polarities and chooses right polarity automatically.
