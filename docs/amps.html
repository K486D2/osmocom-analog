History
</p>

<p>
*TBD*

The Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) was an analog cellular mobile phone system developed by Bell Labs.
From 1968 to 1983 the Bell Labs worked out the system, while Motorola was developing the cellular phone.
Dr. Martin Cooper produced the first handheld phone "DynaTAC8000x", the famous Brick Phone.

To reduce radio noise, a syllabic compandor is used on both ends.
This compresses the audio level dynamics by 2.
An audio level of 25% is raised to 50% by the compressor and lowered to 25% by the expander.
A radio noise floor of 10% would be reduced to 1% by the expander.

</p>

<p>
AMPS does not use a modulated tone to carry bits of information, instead it modulates the radio carrier directly.
This image shows a signal generated by this software, which is similar to a received signal from the phone:
</p>

<p>
Generally a receiver will do de-emphasis and filtering after demodulating the signal.
We don't want that.
It may work, but be sure to use a receiver with discriminator output.
This output gives direct signal of the frequency deviation of the received signal.
The signal on the sound card represents the frequency shift of the received signal.
Many receivers can be modified, so search the Web for more info.
</p>

<p>
On the transmitter we don't want to have filtering and pre-emphasis.
It may work, but be sure to use a transmitter that allows to disable emphasis.
I took the schematics of my transmitter and connected the sound card directly to the PLL.
The transmitter will now shift frequency according the the level of the sound card.
</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Importaint: We need to transmit correct polarity, use auto polarity detection always!</font>
</p>

<p>
In my case, my sound card is connected to a transmitter, where a positive sample value causes a negative frequency deviation.
This is why I need to flip the polarity of the signal, so I generate a negative sample value that causes a positive frequency deviation.
I use the '-f yes' option or '--flip-polarity yes'.
Also it is essential to use a transmitter with direct access to the modulator and and a receiver with direct access to the disciminator.
I use '-p -d' or '--pre-emphasis --de-emphasis' to process emphasis for audio signal in software.
I use the calling channel (control channel) 334, which could also be used as traffic channel (voice channel).

amps.c:390 notice : You selected 'combined control &amp; paging &amp; voice channel'.
This is a hack, but the only way to use control channel and voice channel on one transceiver.
 Some phones may reject this.

 &amp; voice channel.
Base station on channel 334 ready, please tune transmitter to 880.020 MHz and receiver to 835.020 MHz.

frame.c:3658 info   : RX Level: 52% Quality: 60% Polarity: NEGATIVE

</pre>

<p>
You should tune the receiver to 880.020 first, to check if you can hear and decode the idle signal from the base station.
Then tune to actually uplink frequency 835.020 MHz.
The actual level is not yet relevant.
(You may check the quality using '-l 2' or '--loopback 2' command line option and build a radio loop by tuning the receiver to the transmitter.)
</p>

<p>
If the polarity is correct and the volume of the signal (frequency deviation) is about right, you will make the phone register.
The phone will transmit on the uplink.
If not, try other polarity.
This is how my phone registers to my network:
